"""
This script will test mongodb installation. It will perform all 4 CRUD operations, then prompt the user to verify that
the database and collection exist prior to dropping them both. The collection will be empty, but the output stream will
display (READ) the new (CREATE) document from the collection, UPDATE that document, READ the document post-UPDATE, then
DELETE that document, leaving the db and collection.

Before it does any of that, however, it leverages os.system() return values to determine if pip is installed. If it is,
it will <pip install pymongo>, this will run whether pymongo is installed already or not. If pip is not installed, it
will check if python is installed just to be of use to the user, should this portion of the script not work.
It should be understood that this portion of the script exists SOLELY to allow for the `import pymongo`, so this script
may be executed on machines where pymongo is not installed.
